# PagerDuty community Add-ons

This is a public repo of add-ons to PagerDuty taht have been written by our customers or partners. 

## Contributing to this repo:
If you've built something on top of PagerDuty's API that we can display in an iframe, we'd love to see it:

* Each add-on should have its own directory with its own README that explains what it does & how to build a valid URL for your add-on
* you must use the v2 API
* Submit a PR

## How do I install an add-on?
We're working to make this process easier, but right now the only way is via the API: https://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/articles/219948527
